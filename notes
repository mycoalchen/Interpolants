Score matching:
    Training:
        Sample x0
        Sample t uniformly
        Sample epsilon from N
        Sample xt using alpha, beta, x0, t, epsilon
            Can choose any alpha and beta schedule interpolating from 0 to 1
                VE
                VP
        Predict score
        Get loss vs. closed form of score (-epsilon/beta)
            Choose loss weighting based on noise schedule
    Sample either with EM + Langevin (stochastic, recovers DDPM) or probability-flow ODE (deterministic)

Flow matching:
    Training:
        Sample x0
        Sample t uniformly
        Sample epsilon from N
        Sample xt using x0, t, epsilon
            VE
            VP
            Optimal tranport
        Predict flow
        Get loss. vs closed form of flow
            Conditional optimal transport: flow = x0 - noise
    Sample with Euler

Mean flows:
    Training:
        Sample x0
        Sample r, t uniformly
        Sample epsilon from N
        xt = (1 - t) * x + t * epsilon
        Predict mean flow
        Get loss vs. closed form of mean flow
    Sample in one step
